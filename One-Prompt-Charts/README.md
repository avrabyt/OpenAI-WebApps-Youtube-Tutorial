One-Prompt Charts uses [OpenAI](https://openai.com) powered Large Language Models and [Databutton](https://www.databutton.io) for the ease of development. The app utilizes tools like [LangChainAI](https://www.langchain.com) and [PandasAI](https://github.com/gventuri/pandas-ai) for testing. This started as a fun project. Big thanks to [Databutton](https://www.databutton.io) for letting users use prompts for free.
